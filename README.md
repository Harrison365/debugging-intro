# Debugging Intro

Take a look at the exercises folder. Inside, you will see several files. In each one, Northcoders have written a series of functions. Harrison is a fool and has made many mistakes. Please fix them so that, when you run the file with `node <file name>.js`, all the tests pass.

P.S. Please don't make any alterations to the tests && Make sure you have also **cd** into the correct folder before running the file.
